= Antora Xref Extension

The Antora Xref Extension augments Antora's support for xref macros with the following features:

* Validate that the target file contains an anchor that matches the fragment.
* Use default link text from the title or `reftext` of the target.
* Stub links that don't yet exist
* Produce warnings if link text is unnecessary 

See https://github.com/spring-io/antora-xref-extension/ for more details and usage instructions.
